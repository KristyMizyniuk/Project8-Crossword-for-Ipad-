# Project8-Crossword-for-Ipad-
 The «Crossword» application is an application where users have 7 different questions, a hint for every question, a text field, and a keyboard with letters. The task of the game is to answer each question using the keyboard. If users answer correctly each hint turns into a correct answer. After each correct answer user can see the score in the top right corner. After all 7 answers users receive a pop-up notification with congratulations and go to the next level.
